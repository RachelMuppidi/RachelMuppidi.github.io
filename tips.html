      <p>If your brace starts to hurt the first few days you wear it, there is no need to worry! It takes time for your body to adjust to the brace. Make sure that you get a lot rest so that you do not feel as much pain or discomfort.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>If you need more Diamond Bands, you can visit the "Contact Us" tab and order extra brace bands from the company.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Try to keep the brace on for at least ten hours a day. This will help minimize the amount of time you spend in the brace.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Make sure you remember to visit your scoliosis doctor one every six months. This will help your doctor track your back progression. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Always remember that you are strong and brave! Do not be embarrassed to wear your brace to school or other events.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Try not to lie on your stomach since it can cause your thoracic spine to become worse.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Do not carry heavy objects for a long period of time, as the extended pressure can cause more back and muscle pain.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Finding the right matress can help ease the discomfort. Usually, a firm or meduim-firm mattress works the best.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Stretching can help ease the pain and discomfort. You can perform five sets of fifteen repetitions of chest stretches each day. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>If your back starts to ache during the night, you can support your spine with small pillows or rolled-up towels.</p>
